# Triangulation of Polygon and Point Sets
## Michael Jia Hui Loh, Yutaroh Tanaka, Devin Ragotzy

## algorithms to implement
- ear clipping
- polygon decomposition using the monotone mountain technique

## References to add

   - This is Raimund Seidel's "simple and fast incremental randomized algorithm for computing trapezoidal
   decompositions and for triangulating polygons"
 - https://swaminathanj.github.io/cg/PolygonTriangulation.html
   - A nice explanation of how to monotone-ize polygons of different complexities

### Make sure to add this since it was the one I used the most!

   - Has a very simple monotone mountain triangulation algorithm and more explanation

## Files we need to turn in
